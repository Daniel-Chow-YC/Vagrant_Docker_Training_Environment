# Vagrant Docker Training Environment

This project has been created to facilitate easier docker training on Windows 10 home edition or simply for a virtual linux environment if you do not wish to install Docker locally.

As per Docker specifications the Docker desktop edition does not run on Windows 10 Home which is a common edition for many learning on home desktops and laptops. The following instructions will allow you to install a virtual Linux environment with Docker already installed.

# Pre-requisites
